National team career

During his career Price represented the United States national team. He played for them in the 1983 Pan American Games where the team won gold medals, and also represented the national team in the 1994 FIBA World Championship, where they were known as Dream Team II, and won gold medals.

Legacy 

Not long after retirement, Price's number, 25, was retired by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He is a member of the Georgia, Ohio, and Oklahoma Sports Halls of Fame.
The city of Enid, Oklahoma, renamed the basketball arena Mark Price Arena, as a tribute to the NBA player's accomplishments, since he was one of the best basketball athletes in Enid High School history.

Personal life 

Price's father Denny was a successful player at Oklahoma and for the Phillips 66ers, before becoming a college coach for Sam Houston State and Phillips University. His younger brother Brent played ten seasons in the NBA. His daughter Caroline had a short stint in professional tennis after playing for the North Carolina Tar Heels. His son Josh plays college basketball for Trevecca (2021-2022), after attending and playing two years for Liberty Flames. Price is a Christian and attends church.

Coaching career",N/A,N/A,". Price ranked consistently among the assist leaders (as of March 11, 2015, LeBron James surpassed Price's Cavs record of 4,206 assists, taking over 1st place), twice won the Three Point Contest (in 1993 and 1994), and was a four-time All-Star. Price was named to the All-NBA First Team after the 1992–93 season. Price was second in franchise steals with 734, a Cavaliers record that stood until December 9, 2008, when LeBron James surpassed him .
Another one of Price's distinguishing traits on the court was his pioneering of the splitting of the double team. As former teammate Steve Kerr explains, ""Mark really revolutionized the way that people attack the screen and roll. To me, he was the first guy in the NBA who really split the screen and roll. A lot of teams started blitzing the pick and roll and jumping two guys at it to take the ball out of the hands of the point guard. He’d duck right between them and shoot that little runner in the lane. Nobody was doing that at that time. You watch an NBA game now and almost everybody does that 

Price was plagued by injuries late in his career, a factor in his trade to the Washington Bullets prior to the 1995–96 season. He played one season for Washington before moving on to the Golden State Warriors, signing with the Warriors as a free agent in July 1996. Price played 70 games for Golden State and averaged 11.3 points per game. On October 28, 1997, Price was traded to the Orlando Magic for David Vaughn III and Brian Shaw. He spent one season with the Magic before being waived on June 30, 1998, effectively ending his career. 

Later career",". Price graduated in four years with a degree in Industrial Management. 

College records


Professional career

A point guard, he mystified critics who said he was too slow, too small and too deliberate for a high-level game. Selected first in the second round (25th overall) by the Dallas Mavericks in the 1986 NBA draft, he was acquired by the Cleveland Cavaliers in a draft day trade that helped turn the team into an Eastern Conference powerhouse.

Cleveland Cavaliers 

Price was known as one of the league's most consistent shooters. He finished his career with a 90.4% free throw shooting percentage and a 40% three-point field goal shooting percentage . During the 1988–89 season, Price became the second player, after Larry Bird, to join the NBA's 50–40–90 club for those who shot at least 40% from three-point range, at least 50% from the field and at least 90% from the free throw line in a single season, and is still one of only eight players to have ever done this while also achieving the NBA league minimum number of makes in each category",".

Head coaching record 

Jackson has had a winning record every year as a head coach, and currently has the highest winning percentage of any Hall of Fame coach, and the highest of any NBA coach coaching 500 games or more. Along with his NBA-record 11 championships, he is the only coach to win at least 10 championships in any of North America's major professional sports: the records are respectively 6 titles in the NFL, 9 titles in the NHL and 7 titles in MLB .
At the end of the 2010 season he had the fifth-most wins of any NBA coach, and was one of only six to have over 1,000 wins. Of those six he was the only one who had not coached over 1,900 games, and the only one not included in the top 10 total games coached.",". In 1996, as part of celebrations for the NBA's 50th anniversary, Jackson was named one of the 10 greatest coaches in league history.
Jackson retired from coaching in 2011 and joined the Knicks as an executive in March 2014. He was dismissed as the Knicks' team president in 2017. 

Jackson was born in Deer Lodge, Montana on September 17, 1945. His parents, Charles and Elisabeth Funk Jackson, were Assemblies of God ministers. Elisabeth came from a long line of German Mennonites before her conversion to the Assemblies of God. In the churches that they served, his father, Charles, generally preached on Sunday mornings and his mother on Sunday evenings. Eventually, his father became a ministerial supervisor. Phil, his two brothers, and his half-sister grew up in a remote area of Montana in an austere environment, in which no dancing or television was allowed 

Early life . Jackson did not see his first movie until he was a senior in high school, and went to a dance for the first time in college. Growing up, he assumed he would become a minister.
Jackson attended high school in Williston, North Dakota, where he played varsity basketball and led the team to a state title. He also played football, was a pitcher on the baseball team, and threw the discus in track and field competitions. The high school now has a sports complex named after him",". Jackson then told Krause that he seemed to be rooting for the other side, to which Krause responded, ""I don't care if it's 82-and-0 this year, you're fucking gone."" Krause publicly portrayed Jackson as a two-faced character who had very little regard for his assistant coaches.
After the Bulls' final title of the Jordan era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again. However, after taking a year off, he decided to give it another chance with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1999. 

Jackson took over a talented Lakers team and immediately produced results as he had done in Chicago. In his first year in Los Angeles, the Lakers went 67–15 during the regular season to top the league. Reaching the conference finals, they eliminated the Portland Trail Blazers in a tough seven-game series and then won the 2000 NBA championship by beating the Indiana Pacers.

Los Angeles Lakers (1999–2004, 2005–2011) . Green, Robert Horry, and Brian Shaw, and the assistance of former Bulls Horace Grant, Ron Harper, and John Salley, Jackson led the Lakers to two additional titles in 2001 and 2002, against the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets, adding up to his third three-peat as head coach. The main serious challenge the Lakers faced was from their conference rival, the Sacramento Kings",N/A,N/A,N/A,". His brother Chuck speculated years later that the three Jackson sons threw themselves passionately into athletics because it was the only time they were allowed to do what other children were doing. Jackson attracted the attention of several baseball scouts. Their notes found their way to future NBA coach Bill Fitch, who had previously coached baseball, and had been doing some scouting for the Milwaukee Braves. Fitch took over as head basketball coach at the University of North Dakota in the spring of 1962, during Jackson's junior year of high school. 

College career

Bill Fitch successfully recruited Jackson to the University of North Dakota, where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Jackson did well there, helping the Fighting Sioux to third- and fourth-place finishes in the NCAA Division II tournament in his sophomore and junior years (1965 and 1966). Both years, they were beaten by the Southern Illinois Salukis. Jackson's future Knicks teammate Walt Frazier was the Salukis' biggest star, but the two only faced off in 1965, as Frazier was academically ineligible in 1966.

Professional career 

Jackson circa 1968 In 1967, Jackson was drafted in the second round by the New York Knicks. While he was a good all-around athlete, with unusually long arms, he was limited offensively but compensated with intelligence and hard work on defense. Jackson eventually established himself as a fan favorite and one of the NBA's leading substitutes, although he had very little playing time. He was a top reserve on the Knicks team that won the NBA title in 1973

""Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson"". National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame",N/A,". Green said that Johnson should not play, and several NBA players, including Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone, argued that they would be at risk of contamination if Johnson sustained an open wound while on court. Johnson led the West to a 153–113 win and was crowned All-Star MVP after recording 25 points, 9 assists, and 5 rebounds. The game ended after he made a last-minute three-pointer, and players from both teams ran onto the court to congratulate Johnson.
Johnson was chosen to compete in the Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics for the U.S . national team, dubbed the ""Dream Team"" because of the NBA stars on the roster. The Dream Team, which along with Johnson included fellow Hall of Famers such as Bird, Michael Jordan, and Charles Barkley, was considered unbeatable. After qualifying for the Olympics with a gold medal at the 1992 Tournament of the Americas, the Dream Team dominated in Olympic competition, winning the gold medal with an 8–0 record, beating their opponents by an average of 43.8 points per game. Johnson averaged 8.0 points per game during the Olympics, and his 5 .5 assists per game was second on the team. Johnson played infrequently because of knee problems, but he received standing ovations from the crowd, and used the opportunity to inspire HIV-positive people.
Before the 1992–93 NBA season, Johnson announced his intention to stage an NBA comeback. After practicing and playing in several pre-season games, he retired again before the start of the regular season, citing controversy over his return sparked by opposition from several active players . In an August 2011 interview, Johnson said that in retrospect he wished that he had never retired after being diagnosed with HIV, saying, ""If I knew what I know now, I wouldn't have retired."" Johnson said that despite the physical, highly competitive practices and scrimmages leading up to the 1992 Olympics, some of those same teammates still expressed concerns about his return to the NBA. He said that he retired because he ""didn't want to hurt the game",N/A,N/A,".

After two years in college, during which he averaged 17.1 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 7 .9 assists per game, Johnson entered the 1979 NBA draft. Jud Heathcote stepped down as coach of the Spartans after the 1994–95 season, and on June 8, 1995, Johnson returned to the Breslin Center to play in the Jud Heathcote All-Star Tribute Game. He led all scorers with 39 points.
Johnson was drafted first overall in 1979 by the Los Angeles Lakers . Johnson said that what was ""most amazing"" about joining the Lakers was the chance to play alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the team's 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m) center who became the leading scorer in NBA history. Despite Abdul-Jabbar's dominance, he had failed to win a championship with the Lakers, and Johnson was expected to help them achieve that goal. Lakers coach Jack McKinney had the 6-foot-9-inch (2 .06 m) rookie Johnson, who some analysts thought should play forward, be a point guard, even though incumbent Norm Nixon was already one of the best in the league. Johnson averaged 18.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.3 assists per game for the season, was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Team, and was named an NBA All-Star Game starter.
The Lakers compiled a 60–22 record in the regular season and reached the 1980 NBA Finals, where they faced the Philadelphia 76ers, who were led by forward Julius Erving",N/A,". He gave Chastine much of the credit for his development as a basketball player and as a person, saying years later, ""I doubted myself back then."" Johnson and Chastine were almost always together, playing basketball or riding around in Chastine's car. Upon learning of Chastine's death, Magic ran from his home, crying uncontrollably. Johnson, who finished his high school career with two All-State selections, was considered at the time to be the best high school player ever to come out of Michigan . He was also named to the inaugural McDonald's All-American team, which played in the 1977 Capital Classic.
Although Johnson was recruited by several top-ranked colleges such as Indiana and UCLA, he decided to play close to home. His college decision came down to Michigan and Michigan State in East Lansing. He ultimately decided to attend Michigan State when coach Jud Heathcote told him he could play the point guard position. The talent already on Michigan State's roster also drew him to the program.
Johnson did not initially aspire to play professionally, focusing instead on his communication studies major and desire to become a television commentator . Playing with future NBA draftees Greg Kelser, Jay Vincent, and Mike Brkovich, Johnson averaged 17.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game as a freshman, and led the Spartans to a 25–5 record, the Big Ten Conference title, and a berth in the 1978 NCAA tournament. The Spartans reached the Elite Eight, but lost narrowly to eventual national champion Kentucky .
During the 1978–79 season, Michigan State again qualified for the NCAA tournament, where they advanced to the championship game and faced Indiana State, which was led by senior Larry Bird. In what was the most-watched college basketball game ever, Michigan State defeated Indiana State 75–64, and Johnson was voted Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. He was selected to the 1978–79 All-American team for his performance that season. After two years in college, during which he averaged 17.1 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 7",N/A,N/A,". Green said that Johnson should not play, and several NBA players, including Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone, argued that they would be at risk of contamination if Johnson sustained an open wound while on court. Johnson led the West to a 153–113 win and was crowned All-Star MVP after recording 25 points, 9 assists, and 5 rebounds. The game ended after he made a last-minute three-pointer, and players from both teams ran onto the court to congratulate Johnson.
Johnson was chosen to compete in the Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics for the U.S . national team, dubbed the ""Dream Team"" because of the NBA stars on the roster. The Dream Team, which along with Johnson included fellow Hall of Famers such as Bird, Michael Jordan, and Charles Barkley, was considered unbeatable. After qualifying for the Olympics with a gold medal at the 1992 Tournament of the Americas, the Dream Team dominated in Olympic competition, winning the gold medal with an 8–0 record, beating their opponents by an average of 43.8 points per game. Johnson averaged 8.0 points per game during the Olympics, and his 5 .5 assists per game was second on the team. Johnson played infrequently because of knee problems, but he received standing ovations from the crowd, and used the opportunity to inspire HIV-positive people.
Before the 1992–93 NBA season, Johnson announced his intention to stage an NBA comeback. After practicing and playing in several pre-season games, he retired again before the start of the regular season, citing controversy over his return sparked by opposition from several active players . In an August 2011 interview, Johnson said that in retrospect he wished that he had never retired after being diagnosed with HIV, saying, ""If I knew what I know now, I wouldn't have retired."" Johnson said that despite the physical, highly competitive practices and scrimmages leading up to the 1992 Olympics, some of those same teammates still expressed concerns about his return to the NBA. He said that he retired because he ""didn't want to hurt the game",". Archived from the original on June 15, 2022. Retrieved June 9, 2022.

Thomas with Indiana coach Bob Knight during the 1981 NCAA tournament Thomas was recruited to play college basketball for Bob Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers. Although he received mail saying Knight tied up his players and beat them, he did not believe the rumors. When Knight visited the Thomas home, one of Isiah's brothers, who wanted him to attend DePaul, embarrassed him by insulting the Indiana coach and engaging him in a shouting match. Nevertheless, Thomas's mother chose Knight and Indiana because she felt that getting away to Bloomington would be good for her son, as would Knight's discipline .
Thomas quickly had to adjust to Knight's disciplinarian style. At the 1979 Pan American Games in Puerto Rico, Knight got so mad at Thomas he threatened to put him on a plane home. Knight recalled yelling at the freshman-to-be, ""You ought to go to DePaul, Isiah, because you sure as hell aren't going to be an Indiana player playing like that."" Prior to the start of his freshman year, the 1979–80 season, Knight became so upset with Thomas that he kicked him out of a practice . According to Thomas, Knight was making a point that no player, no ""matter how talented, is bigger than Knight's philosophy.""
Thomas quickly proved his skills as a player and became a favorite with both Knight and Indiana fans. His superior abilities eventually caused Knight to adjust his coaching style. Fans displayed bedsheets with quotations from the Book of Isaiah (""And a little child shall lead them"") and nicknamed him ""Mr. Wonderful."" Because of Thomas's relatively short stature for college basketball at 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m), coach Knight would call him ""Pee Wee""",N/A,N/A,".

Biography


Early life and career 

Ramsey was born in Selma, Alabama on July 13, 1937 but spent most of his life in New York City. In his youth, he played in the Rucker Park League, winning the MVP and was known for his wars with Connie Hawkins. After graduating from High School of Commerce, he joined the NYU Violets as a forward in 1956. At NYU, he played with future hall of famer Thomas “Satch” Sanders. Over three years, he averaged 20.2 points per game and 17.5 rebounds . in his senior year, 1958, Ramsey was named as an All-American. When he died, he still held the school record for rebounds in a game, with 34 against Boston College. As of 2018, he was 11th on NYU's all-time scoring list.
After graduating from NYU with a degree in business, Ramsey entered the 1959 NBA draft where the St. Louis Hawks selected him with the 13th overall pick. At a height of 6’4”, Ramsey was short to play the forward position during that era, but was not a strong enough ball handler to play guard .

The following season, he played in two games with the Syracuse Nationals. After his NBA career, Ramsey played semi-pro basketball for one season before injuries forced him to retire.
After his playing days ended, Ramsey charged that a quota system in basketball limited the number of black players in the league at that time.

He then moved to Europe, and played for Baloncesto Fuenlabrada of the Spanish ACB League.
In the 1999–00 season, he was signed by Maccabi Tel Aviv. During his time in Israel, he won three Israeli Premier League championships and Israeli State Cups, and one European FIBA SuproLeague title (2001; when he averaged 17.5 points and 9 rebounds, while playing 30 minutes per game, as the team was 21–3) . He was named the FIBA SuproLeague Player of the Year, as well as the ""Best American Player in Europe"", by Basket News, in 2001.
After his successes in Israel, he was signed in July 2002, by the Toronto Raptors of the NBA to a 3-year, $5.2 million contract (the third year being a team option), and appeared in 7 games, averaging 3.3 points, 3.3 rebounds and 10.9 minutes . Shortly after, Huffman was released by Toronto which terminated his contract in January 2003, because team management charged that he hid a knee injury from them when he signed the contract. Huffman responded by suing them in 2003. In February 2004 an arbitrator ruled that the Raptors were responsible for Huffman's contract. 

Later life and death

After his basketball career, he decided to fund a basketball camp for children in 2005, with retired Romanian-Israeli basketball player Constantin Popa. Huffman was awarded in 2010, by the Michigan Jewish Sports Foundation, with the Book of Life Award.

William Bedford (basketball)

William Bedford (born December 14, 1963) is an American former professional basketball player who was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the first round (6th pick overall) of the 1986 NBA draft after playing at Memphis State University (now known as the University of Memphis). Bedford, a 7'0"" center, played for the Suns, Detroit Pistons and the San Antonio Spurs in six NBA seasons, averaging 4.1 points and 2.4 rebounds per game in his career.

NBA career 

Originally projected as a star player, Bedford's NBA career was marred by drug use, and he missed the 1988-89 NBA season as a result, during which the Pistons won the championship. He returned to the Pistons the following season and played a limited role on their 1989-90 team that successfully repeated as champion, seeing action in 42 of 82 regular-season games .
On November 6, 1990, in a game against the Seattle SuperSonics, Bedford set an NBA record for fewest minutes played in a game with three or more three-pointers made, shooting 3-of-3 from deep in a single minute. These were three of five total three-pointers he made in 60 games during the 1990-91 NBA season, and of seven overall in his career.","

Personal life 

In 1985, eighteen-year-old Jugoplastika junior squad player Rađa began dating nineteen-year-old Željana Listeš [it] from Solin, a basketball player in the club's women's team. The couple got married during late summer 1990 at Vatrogasni dom in Kaštel Sućurac right before Rađa's move to Rome to play for Virtus. Their son Duje was born in 1997 .
By the mid-1990s, Rađa began romantic involvement with singer and 1995 Miss Croatia runner-up Viktorija Đonlić, a relationship that eventually led to divorce from his wife. Rađa married Đonlić in August 2001 on a yacht anchored off the coast of Korčula with singer Petar Grašo as his best man. In 2003, the couple's son Roko was born followed by son Niko in 2008.",N/A,". With Olympiacos, on 16 October 2000, he scored his first points in the EuroLeague competition, under its new format in which it was run by Euroleague Basketball, in a match against Real Madrid.
He returned, once again, to Croatia, joining Cibona for the 2001–02 season. Rađa finished his career in 2003, by winning the Croatian League championship with his first team, Split CO. 

National team career


1989–90: Defection to NBA, court-ordered return to Yugoslavia, and

Rađa was on the senior men's Yugoslavian national team that won the silver medal in the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul. He was also a part of the golden Yugoslavian teams at the 1987 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in Bormio, Italy, EuroBasket 1989 in Zagreb and the EuroBasket 1991 in Rome.

Croatia 

Rađa holding the flag of Croatia with his teammate Dražen Petrović. Following Croatia's independence, Rađa became an important player of the senior men's Croatian national basketball team, most notably at the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona, where Croatia won the silver medal. Rađa was also on the Croatian teams that won the bronze at the EuroBasket 1993 in Germany, 1994 FIBA World Championship in Toronto, and the EuroBasket 1995 in Athens . With 1,764 points scored, he was the all-time top scorer for the Croatian national team until 2018, when he was surpassed by Bojan Bogdanović.",N/A,N/A,". Rađa had three more years left on his guaranteed contract and, according to the NBA regulations, if he was to fail another team's physical, the Celtics would have to pay his entire remaining salary. Unconvinced about Rađa's physical condition, the Celtics gave up on trying to trade him, instead agreeing a buyout of the three years that remained on his contract. Following the buyout, the Celtics waived Rađa on 16 July 1997.
I went to Pitino and asked him if I fit into his plans . With a new coach, I obviously wanted to know what he thought of my game. I loved playing for Boston and just wanted to find out if there was any possibility I might be traded, because I had heard some rumours. Pitino looked me right in the eyes and said, ""Dino, don't worry. You're going to be a big part of our offense. When we run a set play, the ball is going to go through you.' I left the meeting feeling great. Five days later, I found out I was being traded to Philadelphia. I can't tell you how much I felt betrayed . Either Pitino lied or something changed in a matter of a few days.""
Over the course of his four seasons with the Celtics, Rađa averaged 16.7 points and 8.4 rebounds per game in the regular season. In the NBA playoffs, where he only made a single appearance with four games played, he averaged 15.0 points and 7.0 rebounds per game. 

In the wake of his failed physical in Philadelphia and Rick Pitino's unwillingness to keep him on the Celtics' roster, Rađa returned to Europe in July 1997, joining Panathinaikos, a rich and ambitious club bankrolled by the Giannakopoulos brothers (Pavlos and Thanasis) who made their money in the pharmaceutical industry","

Club career

On 27 June 1989, two days after winning the EuroBasket 1989 championship with Yugoslavia and making the All-Tournament Team, the 22-year-old center got drafted by the Boston Celtics in the second round as the 40th pick. Rađa was reportedly on a vacation in Bologna, Italy with his girlfriend while the Celtics were drafting him in New York City's Felt Forum . Right away, he publicly expressed willingness to immediately go to Boston ""if the financial offer is good"", and thus join fellow Yugoslavs Vlade Divac, Dražen Petrović, and Žarko Paspalj, who were also on their way to the NBA that summer.
However, led by the club's general manager Josip Bilić, vice-president Igor Katunarić, and executive board vice-president Željko Jerkov, Jugoplastika was adamant Rađa would not be released since they had him under contract until 1992 . The entire case quickly turned into a months-long saga that played out in the Yugoslav media. The club's head coach, Božidar Maljković, even publicly called on the Yugoslav Basketball Association (KSJ) to adopt safeguard policies, preventing players younger than age 26 from transferring to NBA teams. After weeks of wrangling over his status, Rađa tried to force Jugoplastika's hand by travelling to the U.S. and, on 1 August 1989, unilaterally signing a one-year contract with the Celtics, reportedly worth in the neighborhood of US$500,000","

The club's head coach, Božidar Maljković, even publicly called on the Yugoslav Basketball Association (KSJ) to adopt safeguard policies, preventing players younger than age 26 from transferring to NBA teams. After weeks of wrangling over his status, Rađa tried to force Jugoplastika's hand by travelling to the U.S. and, on 1 August 1989, unilaterally signing a one-year contract with the Celtics, reportedly worth in the neighborhood of US$500,000",".

He furthermore began practicing with the team at their Brandeis University training facilities. However, seeing the situation as a clear case of contract poaching by Boston and its general manager Jan Volk (who claimed Rađa's contract with Jugoplastika was amateur and thus non-binding), the Split club would not budge . Jugoplastika hired legal representation from the New York City-based Parcher, Arisohn & Hayes law firm, seeking an injunction to prevent Rađa from playing for the Celtics on the grounds that he has a valid and legally binding contract with them and further looking for US$6 million in damages on the grounds of ""damaged reputation and lost income"". The case ended up before the United States district court for the District of Massachusetts. Following a hearing on 26 September 1989, Judge Douglas Woodlock ruled in Jugoplastika's favor two days later thus preventing Rađa from staying with the Celtics . Since the player was physically already in Boston, bringing him back to Yugoslavia required some kind of an agreement. By mid-November 1989, Jugoplastika and the Celtics agreed to terms under which the center went back to complete the 1989–90 season in Split before having the rights to his services transferred to the Celtics effective 1 June 1990. The deal centered around the Celtics paying an undisclosed sum of money to Jugoplastika, which in turn agreed to let Rađa go two years short of his contract's completion",". With 1,764 points scored, he was the all-time top scorer for the Croatian national team until 2018, when he was surpassed by Bojan Bogdanović.

Having earned a scholarship to the University of Michigan, Crawford committed to play college basketball with the Wolverines under coach Brian Ellerbe. At the start of the 1999–00 season, however, he incurred a six-game suspension from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA); it retroactively ruled that his high school living arrangement had breached its bylaws on amateurism.[note 1] The controversial ruling was protested by the university, although to no avail. After the suspension, Crawford joined the starting lineup and went on to average 16.6 points, 4.5 assists, and 2 .8 rebounds on the season. Following his freshman campaign, he declared for the 2000 NBA draft. 

Crawford was selected 8th overall in the 2000 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers but was then traded to the Chicago Bulls in a draft-day deal that included the rights to Chris Mihm. In his first year as a Bull, in 2000–01, Crawford struggled with his shot, converting only 35.2 percent from the field. Even so, the rookie was able to score in double-digits 10 times. He averaged 4.6 points, 1.5 rebounds, and 2.3 assists across 61 games (8 starting)

Kermit Washington's mother Barbara graduated from Miner Teachers’ College (later subsumed into University of the District of Columbia); his father Alexander was an X-ray technician. When he was three years old, his parents had a fight in which his uncle was violently attacked with an iron. His parents soon divorced, with his father awarded custody of the children. His mother, who suffered from bipolar disorder, then took him and his older brother Eric from their father on an ill-advised sojourn for which they were poorly prepared 

Early life",N/A,". Pat later said it went deeper than that, as when she met him in college:
It was very hard for him to show affection. Sometimes I would ask him directly if he really cared about me, and he would say something like, ""I think you're really nice."" It was hard for him to be more open than that. He had never really been nurtured, never really been loved. I came to believe if I nurtured him enough, if I loved him enough, he would get past all that. But I don't believe he ever really did .
In the early 2010s, Washington lived in the Washington, D.C. area, where he was employed as a regional representative of the National Basketball Players Association. 

On May 25, 2016, Washington was indicted for embezzling roughly $500,000 meant for children in Africa. On December 4, 2017, he pled guilty to three counts: one of aggravated identity theft, and two of making a false statement in a tax return. Washington used the charity to launder money he received as kickbacks. Washington, as a regional representative for the National Basketball Players Association, referred NBA players to San Diego attorney Ronald Mix, who then made donations to the charity, but were actually illegal referral payments. Washington then withdrew this money for personal spending 

Fraud conviction",N/A,N/A,". Kunnert testified during the trial and contradicted Washington's testimony, angrily branding him a liar. While the two were playing for San Diego their wives became close friends, but their relationship only worsened over time; Washington believed the NBA was keeping Kunnert on the team to prevent him from suing him. Jack Ramsay, Portland's coach, however, said that he chose Kunnert over San Diego center Swen Nater when his team was asked by the league to submit a list of players they considered fair compensation for Walton .
Washington shared time at the Trail Blazers power forward spot with Maurice Lucas at first, but after Lucas' trade to the New Jersey Nets, he became the full-time starter. He played three seasons in Portland, during which he earned a spot in the 1980 NBA All-Star Game, after some of the top players sat out due to injury. During that All-Star weekend, which was held in Landover, Maryland, nearby American U. held a halftime ceremony in which they retired Washington's number. He was named a team captain for the following season . In his post-punch career, numerous players, coaches, and officials noted that he became less aggressive on the court out of fear of getting into another fight; something he never did. Washington started experiencing pain in his back and knees during the 1980–81 season. The pain became unbearable during the 1981–82 season, and he retired in January 1982 after missing all but 20 games. 

Golden State Warriors (1987)

In 1987, after more than five years out of the league, Washington attempted a comeback with the Warriors, but lasted only eight games on the roster (playing in six of them) before being cut.

Retirement",N/A,N/A,". He trained for three hours a day toward the end of his senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at the University of Maryland to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game. 

During the summer between his senior year of high school and his freshman year of college, Washington grew four inches. He began weight training, and ran the steps in his seven-story dormitory building wearing a weighted vest to improve endurance. Washington became more extroverted in college, so much so that he later said his life could be separated into two parts—his pre-college life and his life after college. He has frequently described his college years as ""the happiest time in my life."" He began dating his future wife Pat when he was a freshman 

College years . They met after she noticed him accidentally scoring four consecutive points for the opposing team in a freshman basketball game. She pursued him even though he often remained silent when she spent time with him. A lot of the emergence of Washington's personality is credited to Pat, who encouraged him to be more outgoing and overcome his low self-esteem. Washington spent a lot of his free time practicing in the gym. He played playground basketball in the summer, and was on several Urban League teams. He averaged 19.4 points and 22.3 rebounds on his freshman team at American","
Kermit Washington . He averaged 9.2 points and 8.3 rebounds per game in ten National Basketball Association (NBA) seasons and played in the All-Star Game once. Washington was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers with the fifth overall pick in the 1973 NBA draft. He played sparingly his first three seasons, and sought the help of retired basketball coach Pete Newell before his fourth season. Under Newell's tutelage, Washington's game rapidly improved and he became a starter for several teams. He played for the Lakers, Boston Celtics, San Diego Clippers, Portland Trail Blazers and Golden State Warriors. 

Kermit Washington's mother Barbara graduated from Miner Teachers’ College (later subsumed into University of the District of Columbia); his father Alexander was an X-ray technician. When he was three years old, his parents had a fight in which his uncle was violently attacked with an iron. His parents soon divorced, with his father awarded custody of the children. His mother, who suffered from bipolar disorder, then took him and his older brother Eric from their father on an ill-advised sojourn for which they were poorly prepared 

Early life","

Washington was drafted fifth overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1973 NBA draft. A week before the team began training camp, Pat and Kermit were married. They invited neither of their families; they just drove together to LA's city hall for the ceremony. He had a difficult time making the transition from college center to NBA power forward. Washington also had played in a primarily zone defense system in college and was not versed in man-to-man defense, which is more common in the NBA . He arrived on a team which had legend Jerry West, who was in the waning stages of a career that would result in his becoming the silhouette seen on the NBA's logo. Washington admits that he was terrified of West, and felt anxiety every time he made a mistake in front of him. Though healthy, he played in only 45 games and averaged 8.9 minutes a game his rookie season. He hurt his back that year but kept quiet about it, fearing he would be ""labeled soft."" The injury would bother him the rest of his career . He continued to struggle in his second season, and discovered that finding individual coaching in the professional game at that time was difficult. Between the rigorous schedule, and the coaches assuming players already knew how to play for the most part when they entered the league, no one, including head coach Bill Sharman, was willing to work with him on a one-on-one basis.
Los Angeles acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1975. ""He was my hero"", Washington later said. ""It was a dream come true."" Abdul-Jabbar would later play an important role in the fight that changed Washington's life . Entering his fourth season, Washington knew the only thing keeping him in the league was his guaranteed contract and that the Lakers had essentially written him off. The organization felt he had the requisite physical skills, so they ascribed his failure to excel to mental deficiencies. Washington was particularly disturbed when in a game against Golden State, he got into an awkward collision with Rick Barry, upon which Barry remarked: ""Listen, you better learn how to play this game."" The criticism especially bothered Washington because he felt Barry's rebuke was correct. Desperate to improve, he contacted Pete Newell at the recommendation of an agent",". The game set American University attendance records, and Washington felt light on his feet when he was introduced before the raucous crowd. He managed to score 40 points and in so doing, became just the seventh player to reach the 20/20 mark. He was thrown a party, and there was a campus wide celebration after the game. He graduated with a 3.37 GPA and a degree in sociology. Washington was a two-time Academic All-American, who taught courses in social sciences his senior year.

I want my boy to know I played my first Olympics for him.

In game 4 against the Wizards, George scored a then playoff career-high 39 points. The Pacers were eliminated in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Miami Heat for the third straight year. For his efforts, George was named to the All-NBA third team, which qualified him for the full 30% extension and All-Defensive First Team .
Players on the US national team react after George suffered a serious leg injury during the fourth quarter of an intra-squad scrimmage on August 1, 2014 During the 2014 off-season, George was named to the training camp roster for the US national team that would represent the country at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain. George had been considered a virtual lock to make the roster, but he landed awkwardly at the base of a basket stanchion after fouling James Harden during a Las Vegas scrimmage on August 1, and suffered a compound fracture of both bones in his lower right leg . After George was carted off the court, head coach Mike Krzyzewski addressed the arena stating the scrimmage would not continue out of respect to George and his family. George quickly went into surgery for the fracture, with a pin being inserted in the leg. While no official prognosis was initially given, he was considered likely to miss the entire 2014–15 season. George, who had said he wanted to play at some time during the season, was cleared to put weight on the leg in late September, and was shooting jumpers in practice in late October . He participated in his first full practice of the season on February 26, three days earlier than expected, and was ruled a possibility to play within a week on March 20. On April 5, George made his return to the Pacers line-up for the first time since sustaining his leg injury with Team USA. He scored 13 points in 15 minutes and made two key three-pointers early in the fourth quarter, helping the Pacers defeat the Miami Heat 112–89. He played out the final six games of the season for Indiana, averaging 8.8 points and 3.7 rebounds per game",N/A,N/A,N/A,". By May 2010, mock drafts such as Draft Express, ESPN.com, and The Hoops Report predicted that George would be selected 12th overall by the Memphis Grizzlies. Two days before the draft, Marc J. Spears from Yahoo! Sports wrote an article about an anonymous Eastern Conference scout stating that ""in five years, Paul George will be the best player to come out of this draft"" . Hoping to draft Derrick Favors, the Pacers had discussed a draft trade with the Nets that would have sent Danny Granger and the 10th pick to the Nets for Devin Harris, Yi Jianlian and the 3rd overall pick, but the deal fell through. George was invited to sit in the green room during the draft and was selected tenth overall by the Indiana Pacers. He became the highest NBA draft pick in Fresno State history. On July 1, 2010, he signed his rookie contract with the Pacers; a two-year guaranteed deal worth $3 .9 million, with team options for a third and fourth year.
On October 27, George made his NBA debut against the San Antonio Spurs, playing 23 minutes and scoring 4 points on 1–5 shooting. In a game against the Washington Wizards, he knocked down five three-pointers and finished with a then-career-high 23 points. George averaged 7.8 points, 3.7 rebounds, 1.1 assists on 45% shooting in his first season, starting 19 of his 61 games . For the 2011 Playoffs, George was one of only two rookies from the 2010 NBA Draft to be in the starting lineup for his team, the other being Landry Fields for the New York Knicks. In the playoffs, the Pacers lost in five games to the Chicago Bulls, led by Derrick Rose. Upon completion of his inaugural season, George was named to the 2011 NBA All-Rookie Second Team",".

My mom and my mom’s sister were on a kick with J names … my cousins' names are Jessica, Jenna, Jade, Jaelyn and James. My oldest brother is Justin and my name is Jrue (my mom liked the name Dru, but wanted to figure out how to keep with the J theme). After me though, that kinda ended, because my sister is Lauren and brother is Aaron.
Both of Holiday's brothers, Justin and Aaron, are also NBA players . His younger sister, Lauren, played college basketball on the UCLA women's team.
In July 2013, Holiday married professional soccer player Lauren Cheney. They first met at a UCLA women's basketball game during his only season at the school. While Holiday was approaching his seat, a young girl asked if he was Darren Collison and asked for his autograph. After explaining that he was not Collison and preparing to take his seat, Cheney, who was seated behind him, said, ""Don't worry, you're cuter than Darren"

After six seasons with Minnesota, Love was traded to the Cavaliers in 2014.

After nine seasons with Cleveland, he joined Miami in February 2023, where he reached his fifth NBA Finals in as many playoff appearances.
Love was born on September 7, 1988, in Santa Monica, California, the second of three children to Karen and Stan Love . He grew up in Lake Oswego, Oregon, where he was childhood friends and Little League teammates with fellow future NBA star Klay Thompson. Love played basketball from his earliest days; as a child, he would practice his bounce passes with a cardboard box and study tapes of Wes Unseld. His father Stan, a former NBA big man who was an adept shooter, had his son develop his outside shooting and ballhandling skills.

Later, Love guided UCLA to the regular season Pac-10 conference championship, the conference tournament championship, and a No. 1 seed in the 2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Love helped the Bruins to the Final Four of the tournament, where they lost to the Memphis Tigers, whose season and tournament appearance, in turn, were later vacated . At the end of the 2007–08 regular season, Love was named consensus first-team All-American, Pac-10 Player of the Year, All-Pac-10, and Pac-10 Freshman of the Year. He led the Bruins with 17.5 ppg, 10.6 rpg, and 23 double-doubles.
In a press conference on April 17, 2008, Love announced his intention to leave UCLA to enter the 2008 NBA draft . He was taken fifth overall by the Memphis Grizzlies, immediately after his teammate at UCLA, Russell Westbrook, who was selected by the Seattle SuperSonics. Following the draft, Love was traded, along with Mike Miller, Brian Cardinal, and Jason Collins to the Minnesota Timberwolves, with the third overall pick O. J. Mayo, Antoine Walker, Marko Jarić and Greg Buckner going to the Grizzlies. Love went on to play in the 2008 NBA Summer League and led all players in rebounding .
In his NBA debut on October 29, Love came off the bench to contribute 12 points and nine rebounds in a 98–96 win over the Sacramento Kings. The Timberwolves lost 15 of their first 19 games, prompting the dismissal of head coach Randy Wittman. Timberwolves general manager Kevin McHale assumed duties as head coach and they developed a close relationship. Under McHale, the Timberwolves improved their play in January by going 10–4, with Love averaging a double-double",".5 assists per game as Lake Oswego returned to the state championship game, this time winning behind Love's 24 points and 9 rebounds. In his senior season, he averaged 33.9 points, 17.0 rebounds, and 4 assists per game. Lake Oswego made their third straight trip to the state championship game, losing in a rematch of the prior year's final to South Medford High School and Love's rival Kyle Singler despite 37 points from Love. At the conclusion of the season, Love was named the Gatorade National Male Athlete of the Year . He was also a first-team Parade All-American. He finished his high school career as the all-time leading scorer in Oregon boys' basketball history, with 2,628 points.
In July 2006, Love verbally committed to play college basketball at UCLA. He had also considered playing for North Carolina. Before the 2007–08 season, he received permission from Walt Hazzard to wear number 42 for the Bruins even though the school had retired the number for Hazzard in 1996. After arriving at UCLA, Love regularly sought out retired Bruins legends Bill Walton and John Wooden for advice . His decision to play for UCLA brought anger from fans of Oregon, his father's alma mater, where it was expected Love would play. Prior to a game at Oregon, Ducks fans obtained Love's cell phone number and left obscene messages as well as death threats; the fans also subjected Love's family to obscenities and threw garbage at them during the game. This event, along with similar incidents directed at other players, prompted a discussion of whether abuse by college basketball fans is becoming too extreme.
In the 2008 Pacific-10 Conference men's basketball tournament, the Bruins defeated the USC Trojans, featuring O. J . Mayo, in the semi-finals. Both Mayo and Love were nominated to the All-Pac-10 tournament team. Later, Love guided UCLA to the regular season Pac-10 conference championship, the conference tournament championship, and a No. 1 seed in the 2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Love helped the Bruins to the Final Four of the tournament, where they lost to the Memphis Tigers, whose season and tournament appearance, in turn, were later vacated",N/A,". Love was two short of Elvin Hayes's streak of 55 consecutive double-doubles set in the 1973–74 season. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Wilt Chamberlain holds the record with 227 consecutive double-doubles from 1964 to 1967. The NBA does not recognize the double-double as an official statistic. Love suffered a strained left groin on March 20 against Sacramento. He missed the final six games and nine of the last 11 games of the season due to the injury.
Love led the NBA in rebounding, averaging 15.2 per game . He won the NBA Most Improved Player Award after increasing his points per game by 44 percent and his rebounds per game by 38 percent over his previous season. Love established career highs in rebounding, scoring (20.2), assists (2.5), double-doubles (64), field goal percentage (.470), free throw shooting (.850), and minutes played (35.8). He became the first player to average at least 20 points and 15 rebounds in a season since Malone in the 1982–83 season . While amassing double-doubles, a statistical hallmark of traditional power forwards, Love was also evolving into a stretch four, making a career-high 41.7 percent of his 3's, while upping his three-point attempts to almost three per game. He emerged as the new face of the franchise since Garnett was traded from the Timberwolves to the Boston Celtics in 2007. In 2010–11, Love's No. 42 was the Wolves' top-selling jersey; sales were comparable to Kevin Garnett's when he was in his prime.
This was Love's contract season . He had stated that he wanted to be the Timberwolves' ""designated player"" for a five-year deal  during the offseason (a designated player offer must be made prior to the final year qualifying offer), but he was denied this contract by the Timberwolves. Contract negotiations became tense, leading to an incident where David Kahn (team GM) ""marched"" into the players training room and ""thrust [...] a contract offer sheet into his hands""",N/A,N/A

Standing 6 feet 11 inches (2 .11 m) tall and weighing 242 pounds (110 kg), Antetokounmpo is officially listed as a forward and sometimes described as a point forward, but has been deployed across all five positions. Highly athletic and versatile, Antetokounmpo is often recognized as one of the best all-around players in the NBA, and many analysts have declared him ""positionless"" and as embodying the future of the league.
By the 2016–17 season, Antetokounmpo had established himself as one of the league's most devastating slashers and transition scorers . His rare combination of size and speed frequently enables him to cross half a court in a single dribble and blowing past multiple defenders. A 2017 analysis conducted by Stats SportVU at the behest of FiveThirtyEight showed that Antetokounmpo was able to cover slightly more than 15 feet off a single dribble when driving to the basket, 5 feet further than the average player in the league. In addition, Antetokounmpo has developed his own version of the Euro step, described by Jordan Brenner of ESPN .com as ""the final phase of the move's evolution"", which allows him to directly attack the rim from the three-point arc in a move that ""renders the area between the top of the key and the basket all but undefendable"".

However, he did not get officially counted as an all-star selection, since only players that play in Greece's first division are even eligible to actually be voted to play in the game, and Antetokounmpo was playing in Greece's second division at the time.
On April 28, 2013, Antetokounmpo officially made himself eligible for the 2013 NBA draft. He fulfilled his draft projections as a first-round pick by being selected 15th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks. On July 30, 2013, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Bucks .
Antetokounmpo made his NBA debut on October 13, 2013, at the age of 18 years, 311 days, as one of the youngest NBA players ever.

He scored in double figures 23 times and grabbed at least 10 rebounds twice, with both efforts resulting in double-doubles . He finished the season with 61 total blocks, which led all NBA rookies, and was the seventh-most by a Bucks rookie in franchise history. He was selected to participate in the Rising Stars Challenge at NBA All-Star Weekend in New Orleans, where he tallied nine points, two rebounds, and two assists in 17 minutes.

Greece's roster consisted of many experienced players, most of them previously crowned European champions with their clubs, like Vassilis Spanoulis, Ioannis Bourousis and Nikos Zisis, and Greece was a favorite for a medal, after showing great form in friendly games. At EuroBasket 2015, Greece was unbeaten in the group stages, and reached the quarter-finals, where a tight game ended in favor of the eventual champions, Spain, eventually finishing fifth with a 7–1 record . Antetokounmpo finished the tournament with three double-doubles, and a career-high 17 rebounds against Spain, leading his team in rebounds for the tournament. In eight games, he averaged 9.8 points, 6.9 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game.
Antetokounmpo also played with Greece at the 2016 Turin FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament, where he averaged 15.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 0.7 steals, and 2.0 blocks per game in 3 games played . Greece failed to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics, after being eliminated by Croatia, by a score of 66–61. He also played with Greece during their preparation phase for the EuroBasket 2017.

He averaged 14.8 points, 8.8 rebounds, 2 .4 assists, 2.4 steals, and 0.6 blocks per game, in 5 games played. Greece finished 11th in the tournament after they failed to advance past the second round, which was regarded as a disappointing result in national and international sports media.
He rejoined the team in August 2022. On August 25, 2022, Antetokounmpo scored a national team career-high 40 points, along with 8 rebounds and 5 assists, in a 94–100 overtime loss to Serbia in the 2023 World Cup qualifiers"

In 2010, he was selected to the senior squad, playing limited minutes at the 2010 FIBA World Championship (later known as the FIBA Basketball World Cup) as the United States won the gold medal in an undefeated tournament. In 2012, Curry was excluded from the list of 20 finalists selected for consideration for the 2012 U.S. Olympic team in London, which reportedly left him ""very disappointed"" but motivated to improve his game for future opportunities . In 2014, he took on a larger role with the team, helping them to another undefeated tournament at the 2014 World Cup and scoring 10 points in the final game. On June 6, 2016, Curry withdrew from consideration for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, citing ankle and knee ailments as the major reason behind the decision.
Curry made his Olympic debut with the 2024 U.S. Olympic team in Paris, alongside his longtime head coach Steve Kerr. He initially struggled from the field . In a tightly contested semifinal game against Serbia, Curry led a 17-point comeback in a 95–91 win, finishing with a tournament-high 36 points, 8 rebounds, and 9-of-14 shooting from three-point range. In the final two minutes, Curry made a successful steal, layup, and two clutch free throws to maintain a lead of four points. He set a national record for most points scored in an Olympic knockout game and an Olympic record for most three-pointers made in a knockout game, respectively . His 36 points are the second-most ever scored in a game by an American, behind Carmelo Anthony's 37-point performance against Nigeria in 2012. In a postgame interview, teammate Kevin Durant called Curry's performance ""one of the greatest games I've ever seen him play"". Curry followed up his performance with another successful outing in the final match against France, tallying 24 points, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 8-of-12 shooting from three-point range",".
In 2023, Curry opposed the development of multi-family housing in the wealthy enclave of Atherton, California where he and his family live. In a letter in which Curry and his wife opposed affordable housing in his own neighborhood, they wrote, ""We hesitate to add to the 'not in our backyard' (literally) rhetoric, but ... safety and privacy for us and our kids continues to be our top priority and one of the biggest reasons we chose Atherton as home.""
Curry endorsed Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee and an avid Warriors fan, in the 2024 United States presidential election .

He grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father spent most of his NBA career with the Charlotte Hornets. Dell often took Curry and his younger brother Seth to his games, where they would shoot with the Hornets during warm-ups. The family briefly moved to Toronto, where Dell finished out his career as a member of the Raptors. During this time, Curry played for the Queensway Christian College boys' basketball team, leading them to an undefeated season. He was also a member of Toronto 5–0, a club team that plays across Ontario, pitting him against fellow future NBA players Cory Joseph and Kelly Olynyk . Curry led the team to a 33–4 record, en route to winning the provincial championship.
After Dell's retirement, the family moved back to Charlotte and Curry enrolled at Charlotte Christian School, where he was named all-conference and all-state, and led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. Because of his father's storied career at Virginia Tech, Curry wanted to play college basketball for the Hokies, but was only offered a walk-on spot due in part to his slender 160-pound frame. He ultimately chose to attend Davidson College, who had aggressively recruited him from the tenth grade .
Before Curry even played in his first game for the Wildcats, head coach Bob McKillop praised him at a Davidson alumni event, saying: ""Wait 'til you see Steph Curry. He is something special."" In his first collegiate game against Eastern Michigan, Curry finished with 15 points but committed 13 turnovers. In the next game against Michigan, he scored 32 points, dished out four assists, and grabbed nine rebounds. Curry finished the season leading the Southern Conference in scoring with 21.5 points per game. He was second in the nation among freshmen in scoring, behind only Kevin Durant of Texas . Curry's scoring helped the Wildcats to a 29–5 overall record and a Southern Conference regular-season title. On March 2, 2007, in the Southern Conference tournament semi-finals against Furman, Curry made his 113th three-point field goal of the year, breaking Keydren Clark's NCAA freshman season record for three-pointers.

""Gameday Rundown: Grizzlies Come To Town"". NBA.com",". Since the team reached the championship games of both the Big Ten tournament and the NCAA Tournament, Robinson shares the Michigan (and NCAA) single-season games played record (41) with teammates Abdur-Rahkman, Jon Teske, Zavier Simpson and  Matthews. Members of the 2010–11 Connecticut Huskies also played 41 games (an NCAA record). Over the course of three seasons, Robinson finished his career with 237 made three-point shots (on 41.9% shooting), placing fourth on Michigan's all-time list .
After going undrafted in the 2018 NBA draft, he signed an NBA Summer League contract with the Miami Heat. After 5 Summer League games in which he averaged 12.4 points and 2.4 rebounds while shooting 58% (22-for-38) from the field including 63% (17-for-27) on three-point shots, he agreed to a two-way contract with the Miami Heat and Sioux Falls Skyforce on July 10, 2018. When Robinson made his NBA debut, it was the first by a former Division III player since Devean George . It was the first ever by a Williams Eph. Robinson joined Big X, a team composed of former Big Ten players, in The Basketball Tournament 2018.
Although the Heat's formal training camp did not begin until September 25, 2018, Robinson declined an invitation to participate as part of the G League-manned squad that Team USA used from September 6 through September 17 to qualify for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup so that he could participate in informal developmental training with the Heat . When the Heat began the season with four injured players (Wayne Ellington, Justise Winslow, James Johnson and Dion Waiters), Robinson and fellow two-way player Yante Maten made the official October 15 opening day roster. The team began the season with 14 players under full NBA contracts. When the G League training camps opened on October 22, Robinson stayed with the Heat. Robinson made his NBA debut in the Heat's fourth game of the season on October 24, against the New York Knicks with three points and four rebounds in 10 minutes of action",N/A,".

Kyle Forman Anderson (born September 20, 1993), also known as Li Kai'er[a] (simplified Chinese: 李凯尔; traditional Chinese: 李凱爾; pinyin: Lǐ Kǎi'ěr), is an American-Chinese professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Born in the United States, he played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins 
Kyle Anderson (basketball) . After earning All-American honors as a sophomore in 2013–14, he declared for the 2014 NBA draft and was selected in the first round with the 30th overall pick by the San Antonio Spurs.
Nicknamed ""Slow Mo"", Anderson developed the ball-handling skills of a point guard at an early age, but his height provided him the versatility to play as a forward. As a high school player in New Jersey, Anderson led his teams to two consecutive state titles, and was named state player of the year during his senior year . One of the top recruits out of high school, Anderson was named second-team all-conference in the Pac-12 as a freshman at UCLA while playing mostly at forward. The following season, he moved to point guard, and was voted the Most Outstanding Player of the Pac-12 tournament as the Bruins won their first conference tournament title in six years. He played four seasons with San Antonio before signing with the Memphis Grizzlies in 2018. After four seasons with the Grizzlies, he signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves",". One of the top recruits out of high school, Anderson was named second-team all-conference in the Pac-12 as a freshman at UCLA while playing mostly at forward. The following season, he moved to point guard, and was voted the Most Outstanding Player of the Pac-12 tournament as the Bruins won their first conference tournament title in six years. He played four seasons with San Antonio before signing with the Memphis Grizzlies in 2018. After four seasons with the Grizzlies, he signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves . In 2023, Anderson became a naturalized Chinese citizen and played for their national team in the FIBA Basketball World Cup.
Anderson was born on September 20, 1993, in New York City, and grew up in New Jersey in North Bergen before moving to Fairview while in high school. He attended his first basketball camp at the age of three. Anderson's father, who played basketball at Glassboro State College (now Rowan University) and became a longtime high school coach in New Jersey, groomed him to be a point guard . Although Anderson was tall, his father did not want him to be ""pigeonholed"" as a post player. He had his son play with older players on Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) teams; usually the smallest player on the court, Anderson developed point guard skills early while passing to his larger teammates.
He began his high school career at Paterson Catholic High School.  Although he possessed the skills of a point guard, his 6-foot-5-inch (1.96 m) height led coaches to play him on the wing or in the post . After two years at Paterson Catholic, the school closed, and Anderson moved to St. Anthony High School. Overall, he compiled 119–6 record as a four-year starter, including 65–0 in his two years at St. Anthony. When St. Anthony captured its second straight New Jersey Tournament of champions title and concluded its second straight undefeated season with a 66–62 victory over Plainfield, Anderson was the team's third-leading scorer with 14 points. Still, St. Anthony coach Bob Hurley said Anderson was the team's ""heart and soul and he was the reason we won the game",".
On July 6, 2024, Anderson was traded to the Golden State Warriors in a six-team trade also including the Philadelphia 76ers, Dallas Mavericks, Denver Nuggets and Charlotte Hornets, which became the NBA’s first six-team transaction.
Anderson participated in U16 and U17 training camps for USA Basketball prior to being named to the 2009–10 USA Basketball Men's Developmental National Team . In 2012, he started at power forward for the USA Basketball Junior National Select Team that competed at the Nike Hoop Summit, which featured the top American high school seniors against a team of international players aged 19 or younger.
In 2023, Anderson said that he would consider playing for the Chinese national team. On July 24, 2023, the Chinese Basketball Association announced that he had obtained Chinese citizenship in advance of the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup .
Out of high school, Anderson was considered capable of playing any of four positions on the court, from point guard to power forward, drawing comparisons to basketball legend Magic Johnson. Anderson's high school coach Bob Hurley said, ""I think he's a modern-day Magic Johnson. I think that let him play the point. He gets everybody shots. You don’t have him back defensively balancing the floor, you’re wasting him. But you let him do a lot of what the point guard stuff entails. But then also defensively you don’t bother guarding him on the little guy . Put him on maybe the three man or even sometimes the four man if he’s a step-out player."" During his sophomore year in UCLA, CBSSports.com wrote that Anderson was ""starting to look more and more like the Magic Johnson of the 2013–14 season in college basketball."" ESPN analyst Dick Vitale warned against calling him the next Magic Johnson, but stated that ""he has the mini-version of that kind of skill.” USA Today commented that he was ""kind of a poor man's Magic Johnson"".
The Seattle Times called Anderson the ""[m]ost versatile player in years in the Pac-12",N/A,".
On April 9, 2023, during a win against the New Orleans Pelicans, Anderson was involved in an altercation with his teammate, Rudy Gobert. Gobert struck Anderson after a verbal exchange, resulting in Gobert being escorted off the court. Gobert did not return to the game, and was later sent home from the locker room. In his first season with the Timberwolves, Anderson averaged 9.4 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game .

The Seattle Times called Anderson the ""[m]ost versatile player in years in the Pac-12 ."" In 2014, SI.com said he ""[m]ight be the most versatile player in the country.""  Rarely has a player of Anderson's stature—standing 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) with a wingspan of 7 feet 3 inches (2.21 m)—been entrusted to run the offense of a college team.  He was a unique talent with a size advantage to post up smaller defenders down low, and the ball-handling skills to run the offense from the top of the key",".
On April 16, 2014, Anderson announced that he would forgo his remaining collegiate eligibility and enter the 2014 NBA draft. While he disproved detractors who thought his style would not translate to success at the major college level, critics also said his lack of quickness would be an impediment in the NBA. Many teams projected him as a power forward, with some comparing him to Boris Diaw, a longtime NBA player with point forward skills who also plays at a leisurely pace .
Generally projected as a late first-round pick, Anderson was selected in the first round with the 30th overall pick of the draft by the San Antonio Spurs, who had recently won the 2014 NBA Finals. On July 12, 2014, he signed with the Spurs and joined them for the Las Vegas Summer League. In six summer league games, he spent most of the time on the wing with some minutes at power forward, but rarely as a point guard. Anderson began the 2014–15 season as the team's lone new player, with the rest of its championship roster intact . The Spurs often rested its starters, resulting in playing time for Anderson. He made his NBA debut four games into the season, playing a team-high 31 minutes in a 98–81 loss to the Houston Rockets, while coach Gregg Popovich rested veteran stars Tim Duncan and Manu Ginóbili in the second game of a back-to-back set for the Spurs. Anderson shot just 1-of-8, but displayed his skill set with eight rebounds, four assists and two steals; he also acted as San Antonio's primary ball handler during the fourth quarter .

He made his NBA debut four games into the season, playing a team-high 31 minutes in a 98–81 loss to the Houston Rockets, while coach Gregg Popovich rested veteran stars Tim Duncan and Manu Ginóbili in the second game of a back-to-back set for the Spurs.

James grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities",N/A,". He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year. Afterwards, Krzyzewski said: ""[James] is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now.""
After a 12-year gap, James rejoined the national team on the 2024 Olympic squad in Paris as Team Captain at 39 years old. Voted by the entire 592-strong U.S . delegation, James was named as one of the two Team USA flag-bearers for the opening ceremony of the games, becoming the first male basketball player to be so honored. James led the team in rebounds and assists. He recorded his second Olympic triple double in a comeback win in the semi-final against Serbia with 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. James became the first player in Olympic history with two triple doubles. Team USA went on to win their fifth straight gold medal, defeating France 98–87 in the final game, with James recording 14 points, 6 rebounds and 10 assists . At the conclusion of the tournament with averages of 14.2 points, 6.8 assists and 8.5 rebounds, James was named the FIBA Men's Olympics MVP and was selected to the FIBA Men's Olympics All-Star Five.

Standing 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) tall and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg), James has played the majority of his career at the small forward and power forward positions, but he has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary . His playing style, which is athletic and versatile, has drawn comparisons to Basketball Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan. Through the 2023–24 season, James' career averages are 27.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.5 steals, and 0.7 blocks per game. Throughout the 2010s, he was usually ranked as the best player in the NBA each season by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.
James drives to the basket in March 2008",N/A,". Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors, after which a new nickname, ""LeBronto"" was popularized. In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland lost 124–114 in overtime. Following the loss, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series. The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James averaging 34 points, 8 .5 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game for the Finals.
On June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent. Two days later, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers; the deal was officially completed on July 9. In an interview with Sports Illustrated, James's agent Rich Paul explained: ""In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise . In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do."" Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination.
The Lakers expected James to immediately transform them into a championship contender after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the Finals since 2010. Following his signing, the team rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans . To begin the 2018–19 season, the Lakers struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games. In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James's strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers. Four days later, James scored a season-high 51 points in a victory over the Heat",".

Throughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.: 142  Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to Ohio-based subscribers for $7.95 per game on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season, but ended up not being profitable.: 143  For the year, James averaged 30.4 points, 9.7 rebounds, 4 .9 assists, and 2.9 steals per game, was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,: 178  and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year. He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft .
Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, James skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player. This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source . Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility. James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season. In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points. St. Vincent–St",".

After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat; this was announced in a nationally televised special titled The Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history",". NBA analyst Brian Windhorst, who spent his career covering James, recounted: ""No one has ever had as much hype as James has had to live up to, and James has delivered on every last drop."" James left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in NBA history.[e] Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season. As of 2024, James has been named to 20 All-NBA Teams, including 13 times to the First Team, which are both NBA records . His four MVP awards are matched only by Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span. James has also won four Finals MVP Awards, which is the second-most all-time, and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014. While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals . His teams have appeared in the Finals ten times and won four championships; his 10 Finals appearances are tied for third all-time.[f] Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have countered that James usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition.
On the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history,[g] and he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s. This has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan .[a] In a 2016 interview with Sports Illustrated, James acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing Jordan as the greatest. In February 2018, The Ringer spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Bill Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead. In polls, James has ranked second behind Jordan. The results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing Jordan. Davis et al. of Business Insider stated: ""The data would suggest that younger, more-engaged NBA fans lean toward James, as he's still playing. Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan",". Retrieved July 15, 2024.

",". In Game 1 of the conference semifinals, Looney had 10 points, 23 rebounds, and five assists in a 117–112 loss to the Lakers. He came off the bench in the remainder of the series as the Warriors attempted to counter the Lakers' Anthony Davis.
On March 7, 2024, Looney saw his streak of 290 consecutive games played snapped after being declared inactive by Steve Kerr prior to that day's game against the Chicago Bulls. The designation served as the first game Looney did not play in since March 20, 2021 .
Standing at 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m), Looney is most suited to playing power forward. Possessing a 7-foot-4-inch (2.24 m) wingspan, he is also a capable, small-ball center who is able to guard all five positions. Looney's length allows him to switch assignments and defend guards. He moves fairly well on the perimeter, and is not easily lured by pump fakes. Looney can also defend the rim.
Looney had limited mobility after his hip surgeries . Lacking explosion, he worked on faking opponents and getting his defender off balance. After becoming healthier and losing weight, Looney became more athletic and proficient at catching lob passes. During the summer 2018 off-season, he worked on finishing the lobs without having to land first. Looney practices in a Shoot 360 facility in Oakland, which gives players feedback in real time on their technique. He said: ""I like to get the feedback. How did I shoot today? Was my shot flat on my misses? What was causing my misses?""
In addition to his brother Kevin, Looney has an older sister named Summer . His cousin Nick Young also played in the NBA, and they were teammates on the Warriors in 2017–18.

Kevon Looney . He has won three NBA championships with the Warriors.
Growing up in Wisconsin, Looney was named the top high school player in the state as a senior in 2014. He also received national recognition as a five-star prospect and earned All-American honors. In his only season at UCLA, Looney led all freshmen in the nation in double-doubles, recording double figures in both points and rebounds in 15 games. One of the top players in the Pac-12, he was also named to their all-freshman team . As a rookie with Golden State, Looney's playing time was limited after undergoing surgery on both his hips. The next season, a strained left hip sidelined him for most of the playoffs during their championship run. Finally healthy in 2017–18, Looney became a regular in the Warriors' rotation as an undersized center, helping them win a second straight championship. Looney won a third championship with Golden State in 2022 as their starting center.
Looney was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Doug and Victoria Looney . Growing up, he was coached by his father, who played as a forward at Schreiner University in Kerrville, Texas, and became the school's career rebounding leader. Looney also watched his brother Kevin, who was six years older, play pickup games. Like his brother, Looney became a Los Angeles Lakers and Kobe Bryant fan, and watched tapes of Bryant, copying his moves. His brother would let him play basketball with him, but only if Kevon rebounded more and shot less.

Looney was already being recruited by colleges as a freshman, receiving offers from in-state schools Marquette and Wisconsin. In his sophomore year in 2012, Looney was named Player of the Year of the Milwaukee City Conference after averaging 20.9 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 2.0 assists per game. As a junior, he averaged 26.1 points, 12.4 rebounds, 7.0 blocks, and 3.1 assists per game, leading a team of mostly unproven players to a runner-up finish for the conference title .
In his final season, Looney averaged 27.9 points, 12.7 rebounds, 7.0 assists, and 8.0 blocks per game; both CBS Sports and The Post-Crescent called his averages ""nearly"" a quadruple-double. Although Looney was Hamilton's tallest player, he was also their best passer, and played mostly at point guard. Capable of handling the ball, creating his own shot, and shooting, mixtapes on YouTube hailed Looney as ""the next KD"", in reference to future Golden State teammate Kevin Durant . Hamilton went undefeated in conference play to win its first league title in four years, and Looney earned his second City Conference player of the year award. Looney gained national recognition, becoming just the second player in Milwaukee Public Schools history, and the sixth ever in Wisconsin, to be named a McDonald's All-American; he was also a Parade All-American. Looney was named Wisconsin Mr. Basketball by the Wisconsin Basketball Coaches Association, and both Gatorade and the Associated Press named him their state player of the year. Looney was listed as a five-star prospect by Rivals.com, ESPN.com and Scout .com, who ranked him nationally as the No. 10, No. 12, and No. 15 player, respectively.
Hamilton retired Looney's No. 5 in 2018. He considered changing his number when he was a sophomore, but Looney's close friend Wati Majeed talked him out of it: ""You're No. 5, that's who you are. You can play all five positions and guard all five positions.""

He was also recognized nationally as a first-team Parade All-American. He played in the Ballislife All-American Game, and won the event's slam dunk contest. Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, LaVine was listed as the No. 12 shooting guard and the No. 44 player in the nation in 2013 .
On June 20, 2012, LaVine verbally committed to attending the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and playing for coach Ben Howland for the 2013 season. After Howland was fired nine months later, LaVine considered staying in-state and attending the University of Washington instead. However, he decided to remain with UCLA and their new coach, Steve Alford; LaVine had inherited an affection for UCLA from his father, who grew up a fan of Bruins basketball while growing up in nearby San Bernardino, California .
After a strong start to 2013–14 as the team's sixth man, featuring an impressive display of outside shooting and explosive dunks, the former point guard LaVine evoked memories of former Bruin Russell Westbrook's UCLA beginnings. NBA draft pundits began ranking LaVine high on their projections for the 2014 NBA draft if he declared himself eligible. ESPN.com draft expert Chad Ford attributed LaVine's appeal to the Westbrook comparisons. At one point, Ford projected him as the 10th overall pick, while NBADraft.net ranked him fifth . During the season, LaVine typically entered the game with coach Alford's freshman son, Bryce Alford, who usually handled the ball, while starter Kyle Anderson was the team's main facilitator. During a six-game span beginning on January 26, 2014, LaVine endured a shooting slump where he made just 7 of 36 shots from the field. He averaged 9.4 points per game during the season, fourth best on the team, and his 48 three-point field goals made were the second most by a freshman in the school's history",".

Rubio returned in February 2015, resulting in a dip in playing time for LaVine. However, Williams was also traded that month which opened up more opportunities.

During the 2016 All-Star Weekend, LaVine scored 30 points for Team USA in the Rising Stars Challenge to capture MVP honors.

Michael Jeffrey Jordan,1963/2/17,American,62,"Chicago Bulls, Washington Wizards",Backcourt,3.0,1984.0,University of North Carolina,6.0,5,2.0,0.0,128,"

Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials MJ, is an American businessman and former professional basketball player. He played 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) between 1984 and 2003, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. He was integral in popularizing basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a global cultural icon. His profile on the NBA website states, ""By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time 
Michael Jordan .""
Jordan played college basketball with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the best defensive players. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames ""Air Jordan"" and ""His Airness""",N/A,". Jordan is widely regarded as the greatest basketball player of all time – he changed so many different facets of the league – but maybe most of all, he showed players they could grow themselves into a global brand on and off the floor with stellar play and the right marketing machine behind it all.

Lazenby, Roland (2014). Michael Jordan: The Life. p. 43",N/A,N/A,".
In 1992, Jordan, now an NBA player, was a member of the star-studded squad that was dubbed the ""Dream Team"", which included Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. The team won two gold medals: the first in the 1992 Tournament of the Americas, and the second in the 1992 Summer Olympics. Jordan was the only player to start all eight games in the Olympics, averaged 14.9 ppg, and finished second on the team in scoring. He was undefeated in the four tournaments he played for the United States national team, and Jordan won all 30 games he took part in .
Jordan was a shooting guard who could also play as a small forward, the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards, and as a point guard. Jordan was known throughout his career as a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests. His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash talk and well-known work ethic. Jordan often used perceived slights to fuel his performances . Sportswriter Wright Thompson described him as ""a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediately sensing and attacking someone's weakest spot"". As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not ""tough enough"" to compete with him in practice. To improve his defense, Jordan spent hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvization.
Noted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986–87 to 2001–02, when he injured his right knee . Of the 15 seasons Jordan was in the NBA, he played all 82 regular season games nine times. Jordan has frequently cited David Thompson, Walter Davis, and Jerry West as influences. Confirmed at the start of his career, and possibly later on, Jordan had a special ""Love of the Game Clause"" written into his contract, which was unusual at the time, and allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere.
Jordan had a versatile offensive game and was capable of aggressively driving to the basket as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate",".0 rpg and 1.8 apg.
Jordan was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons. After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina a year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986, when he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography . In 2002, Jordan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.
The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center . Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan. Citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.
Jordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium on October 26, 1984, and scored 16 points . In 2021, a ticket stub from the game sold at auction for $264,000, setting a record for a collectible ticket stub. During his rookie 1984–85 season with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting, and helped make a team that had won 35% of games in the previous three seasons playoff contenders. He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas. Roy S",N/A,".

While playing against the Miami Heat on March 26, 2024, Green appeared to grab the neck of Patty Mills and pulled him to the ground. After review by the officials, the foul was deemed common instead of flagrant. On April 12, Green put up a double-double with 12 rebounds and 11 assists in a 114–109 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. He became the first player in NBA history to record a double-double without taking any field goal attempts.
Green represented the United States national team at the 2011 Summer Universiade men's basketball tournament in Shenzhen, China . Team USA finished in fifth place in the tournament as Green averaged 8.6 points and 6.0 rebounds with a 46.3% shooting percentage. In June 2016, Green was named to the 2016 U.S. Olympic team. He helped Team USA win the gold medal in Rio, and in eight games, he averaged 1.9 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 1.2 assists per game. Green was selected as one of the players on the 2020 Olympic team to compete in Tokyo, which was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic . He helped Team USA win the gold medal, and in six games, he averaged 3.5 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 2.8 assists per game while shooting 77.8% from the field.
Though he is considered undersized for a power forward at 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m), Green is a versatile defender, capable of guarding all five positions as both an interior and perimeter defender. Green studies opponents' habits, and leverages his preparation along with his muscular frame and lower-body strength, and is capable of generating rebounds, steals and blocks . He has been named to multiple NBA All-Defensive Teams, and was named the 2016–17 NBA Defensive Player of the Year.
Offensively, he can handle the ball on fast breaks and deliver passes to his teammates for scores. He is a capable three-point shooter who provides spacing for the offense by stretching the opposing defense. Green is also adept at scoring around the basket. His outstanding interior defense combined with his offensive repertoire form a unique two-way skill set.

""Warriors' Draymond Green fined, not suspended, will play Friday""",". This versatility and efficiency at the position has resulted in many analysts discussing Green as embodying the future direction of the center position in the NBA, with some even calling him the league's best center.
During the 2015–16 season, Green dramatically increased his play-making role on the team, doubling his assists average to a team-leading 7.4 per game—good for seventh in the league and by far the most assists by any power forward that year . Green's ball handling, court vision and unselfishness in a point forward role have been repeatedly cited as a reason why the Warriors improved from 2014–15 to 2015–16. In 2015–16, Green played approximately 20 percent of his minutes in that role, with the Warriors outscoring their opponents by 26.6 points per 48 minutes . Though he took a lesser role on offense for the 2016–17 season, thanks to the addition of former MVP Kevin Durant, he took a step forward on defense, finally winning the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award that he coveted after two straight seasons as runner-up to Kawhi Leonard. Green is said to have played a significant role in the recruitment of Kevin Durant to join the Warriors.
He is widely viewed as the emotional and motivational ""heart and soul"" of the Warriors and is noted for his vocal leadership on the court and in the locker room . As the Warriors pushed to the close of a record-setting 2015–16 season, Green was vocal about his desire to break the Chicago Bulls' all-time wins record, and sought the input of his teammates to make sure the team successfully pushed toward the goal together. Green and Curry's on-court chemistry has been cited as a key to the Warriors' improvement in 2015–16, as Green's outspoken, fiery desire has meshed with Curry's quieter, implacable confidence to give the team ""dual—and at times dueling—alpha dogs"" that are ultimately mutually supporting",".
On March 16, 2012, Green recorded his third career triple-double against LIU-Brooklyn in the second round of the 2012 NCAA tournament and joined Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson as just the third player in NCAA history to have two career triple-doubles in the NCAA tournament. On March 22, 2012, in a loss to Louisville, Green collected 16 rebounds, bringing him to 1,096 career rebounds, the most in Michigan State history ahead of Greg Kelser . He ended his career as one of three players in Michigan State history with over 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.
Green was selected with the 35th overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. On July 30, 2012, he signed a three-year, $2.6 million contract with the Warriors. In his NBA debut in the Warriors' season opener on October 31 against the Phoenix Suns, Green played one minute, made one defensive rebound, and committed one foul . Green gradually received more playing time in subsequent games, especially in the wake of injuries to Brandon Rush and Richard Jefferson. After getting only marginal floor time at the beginning of the season, by November 22, Green was playing 15–20 minutes per game, and by December 9, as Green gained a bigger role on the team, the Warriors had won 8 of 10 games. On December 12, Green made the winning layup with 0.9 seconds left in the Warriors' 97–95 win over the defending champion Miami Heat .
In Game 1 of the first round of the 2013 playoffs against the Denver Nuggets on April 20, Nuggets' guard Andre Miller drove around Green and made the game-winning layup in the Nuggets' 97–95 win over the Warriors. Improving on his three-point percentage and offensive performance over the course of the series, Green helped the Warriors win the first round in six games. On May 8, Green started Game 2 of the Warriors' second-round series against the San Antonio Spurs",". Considered one of the greatest defensive players in the league, he is an eight-time All-Defensive Team, 2017 NBA Defensive Player of the Year and led the league in steals. Green has been a runner-up for the Defensive Player of the Year Award three times in his career.
Green grew up in Saginaw, Michigan, and he played college basketball for the Michigan State Spartans, helping them earn two Final Four appearances and a Big Ten tournament championship in 2012 .

He was drafted 35th overall in the 2012 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors and later played a key role on the Warriors' 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2022 championship teams .
Green, who often plays significant minutes for the Warriors as an undersized center in their ""Death Lineup"", has been cited as one of the leaders in an emerging trend in the NBA of versatile frontcourt players capable of playing and defending multiple positions as well as making plays for teammates. He is considered one of the best passers and defensive players of the 2010s, known for his steals, shot-blocking, rebounding, and overall defensive play. Criticized for his on-court conduct and physically aggressive play, he has the second-most career ejections of any NBA player .
Green attended Saginaw High School in Saginaw, Michigan, where he played for coach Lou Dawkins. As a sophomore in 2005–06, he averaged 12 points and 11 rebounds per game.

After being limited during the preseason by a sore knee, Green played unhindered over the first 10 games of the season. On November 5 against the Memphis Grizzlies, Green was limited to just under 14 minutes because of a bruised right foot. He subsequently missed the next two games because of a sprained right toe. He returned to action on November 12 against the Los Angeles Clippers.  A heated argument during and after the game between himself and Kevin Durant over Durant's upcoming free agency status led to Green's being suspended for the Warriors' contest the following day against the Atlanta Hawks . He played on November 15 against the Houston Rockets, but then missed the next 11 games with the same sprained toe on his right foot. In his return game on December 10, he had seven points, 10 rebounds and seven assists in a 116–108 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.

As a high school senior at Chino Hills High School in 2016, Ball was awarded multiple national high school player of the year honors, and led his team, alongside his brothers LiAngelo and LaMelo, who are both current professional basketball players, to an undefeated 35-0 record, as well the consensus national top ranking. As a college freshman in 2016–17, he led the nation in assists and broke the UCLA record for the most assists in a season. Ball also won the Wayman Tisdale Award as the top freshman in the nation .
As an NBA rookie with the Lakers, his playing time was limited by shoulder and knee injuries, and he was sidelined for much of his second season after an ankle injury. He was traded at the end of the season to the New Orleans Pelicans in a trade package for Anthony Davis. He played two seasons with the Pelicans before joining the Bulls in a sign-and-trade deal, but a persistent knee injury has sidelined him for the majority of his tenure with the team, with him missing the entirety of the 2022–23 and 2023–24 seasons .
Ball was born in Anaheim, California, to LaVar and Tina Ball, who were both former college basketball players. The 6-foot-6-inch (1.98 m) Ball started playing basketball at the age of two.

On July 17, 2018, Ball underwent an arthroscopic surgery on his left knee to repair a torn meniscus.

They also signed veteran point guard Rajon Rondo to mentor and compete with the youngster. A week before camp, Lakers coach Luke Walton stated that Ball would be eased back and not participate in full-contact practices initially.
Ball's added bulk made him better on defense, and he became one of the Lakers' most dynamic defenders during the season as he picked up point guards full-court to create turnovers in the backcourt. On offense, he had to adjust to playing off the ball more with James often handling the ball . On December 15, in a 128–100 win against the Charlotte Hornets, the duo became the first teammates to achieve a triple-double in the same game since Jason Kidd and Vince Carter did it in 2007, with Ball posting 16 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, while James had 24 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists.

He ended his career ranked eighth in UCLA history in career scoring (1,802) and career steals (178), and ninth in total games played (134).
Considered a borderline first-round pick after college, Jaquez was invited to the green room of the 2023 NBA draft . He was selected by the Miami Heat with the eighteenth overall pick, the only Pac-12 player selected in the first round. He was the first UCLA senior selected in the first round since Darren Collison in 2009. On July 1, Jaquez officially signed with the Heat. Shortly after, he joined Miami for the 2023 Summer League, but played just two games before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.
Jaquez began the 2023–24 regular season on a minutes restriction following a preseason groin injury . On October 28, 2023, Jaquez made his first career start when he and second-year player Nikola Jović entered the lineup against the Minnesota Timberwolves, filling in for the absence of veterans Jimmy Butler and Kevin Love. Against the Memphis Grizzlies on November 8, Jaquez played the entire fourth quarter and made a game-clinching 3-pointer to extend Miami's lead from three to six with 18.4 seconds left in a 108–102 win . In the following game with Butler and Tyler Herro unavailable, he made his third start of the season, finishing with a then career high of 20 points in 39 minutes in a 117–109 win over the Atlanta Hawks. On December 4, Jaquez was named the Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for games played in October/November. It marks the 10th time a Miami Heat rookie has won the honor and the fifth player to do so, joining Caron Butler (four times), Kendrick Nunn (three times), Josh Richardson and Michael Beasley",".

On June 3, 2011, O'Neal held a press conference at his home in Orlando to officially announce his retirement.
While in college, O'Neal was considered for the Dream Team to fill the college spot, but it eventually went to future teammate Christian Laettner . His national team career began in the 1994 FIBA World Championship in which he was named MVP of the Tournament. While he led the Dream Team II to the gold medal with an 8–0 record, O'Neal averaged 18 points and 8.5 rebounds and recorded two double-doubles. In four games, he scored more than 20 points. Before 2010, he was the last active American player to have a gold from the FIBA World Cup .
He was one of two players (the other being Reggie Miller) from the 1994 roster to be also named to the Dream Team III. Due to more star-power, he rotated with Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson and started 3 games. He averaged 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds with 8 total blocks. Again, a perfect 8–0 record landed him another gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta .

Kobe Bean Bryant,1978/8/23,American,47,Los Angeles Lakers,Backcourt,13.0,1996.0,,5.0,1,2.0,0.0,138,"

Kobe Bean Bryant (/ˈkoʊbi/ KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA) 
Kobe Bryant . Regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of basketball, Bryant won five NBA championships and was an 18-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time NBA Finals MVP. He ranks fourth in league all-time regular season and postseason scoring. Bryant was posthumously voted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021",N/A,". Bryant scored 20 points, including 13 in the fourth quarter, along with six assists, as Team USA defeated Spain 118–107 in the gold medal game on August 24, 2008, for its first gold medal in a worldwide competition since the 2000 Olympics. He averaged 15.0 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 2.1 assists while shooting .462 from the field in eight Olympic contests.
Bryant rejoined the national team for the 2012 Summer Olympics. After winning another gold medal, he decided to retire from the team . Bryant finished his national team career with a record of 26–0 across three tournaments, winning a gold medal each time.
Bryant primarily played as a shooting guard. He was listed at 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) and 212 pounds (96 kg), Bryant was often cited as one of the most dangerous scorers in the NBA. He has drawn frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan, after whom Bryant modeled his playing style. Like Jordan, Bryant became most known for shooting a fall-away jump shot . Chris Ballard of Sports Illustrated described another of Bryant's most famous moves as the ""jab step-and-pause"" in which Bryant jabbed his non-pivot foot forward to let the defender relax but instead of bringing the jab foot back, Bryant pushed off of it and drove around his opponent to get to the basket.
Bryant established a reputation for taking shots in the closing moments of tight games, even when he was double or triple-teamed, and was noted as one of the premier closers in the NBA . In a 2012 annual survey of NBA general managers, Bryant was selected for the 10th consecutive season as the player general managers would want to take a clutch shot with a game on the line. Bryant enjoyed being the villain, and reveled in being booed and then silencing the crowd with his play. Bryant's ability to make difficult shots has also drawn criticism of his shot selection. Throughout his career, Bryant was disparaged for being a selfish, high-volume shooter; he missed more field goal attempts in his career than any other player in NBA history",N/A,".

The Lakers were looking to trade their starting center Vlade Divac for a player's draft rights to free up salary cap space to make an offer to free-agent center Shaquille O'Neal. Bill Branch, the Charlotte Hornets' head scout at the time, said that the Hornets agreed to trade their No. 13 pick to the Lakers the day before the draft . Before the trade agreement, the Hornets never considered drafting Bryant. During the draft, the Lakers told the Hornets whom to select minutes before the pick was made. Bryant was the first guard drafted directly out of high school. After the draft, the trade was put in jeopardy when Divac threatened to retire rather than be traded from Los Angeles. However, on June 30, Divac relented on his threat and the trade was made final on July 9, 1996, when the league's off-season moratorium ended . Since Bryant was still 17 at the time, his parents had to co-sign his contract with the Lakers until Bryant was able to sign his own when he turned 18 before the season began. Bryant signed a three-year rookie contract totaling $3.5 million.
Bryant debuted in the Summer Pro League in Long Beach, California, scoring 25 points in front of a standing-room-only crowd. Defenders struggled to get in front of him, and his performance excited West and Lakers coach Del Harris. Bryant scored 36 points in the finale and finished with averages of 24.5 points and 5 .3 rebounds in four games.

At Adidas ABCD Camp, Bryant earned the 1995 senior MVP award while playing alongside future NBA teammate Lamar Odom . While in high school, then 76ers coach John Lucas invited Bryant to work out and scrimmage with the team, where he played one-on-one with Jerry Stackhouse.

Paul was a McDonald's All-American in high school and attended Wake Forest University for two years of college basketball, where he helped the Demon Deacons achieve their first-ever number-one ranking. Paul was selected as the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft by the New Orleans Hornets, where he developed into one of the league's best players, finishing second in NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting in 2008 . During the 2011 offseason, the Hornets organized a deal to send Paul to the Los Angeles Lakers, but the transaction was controversially voided by the NBA. He was instead dealt to the Los Angeles Clippers later that year. Led by Paul's playmaking, the Clippers developed a reputation for their fast-paced offense and spectacular alley-oop dunks, earning them the nickname ""Lob City"".
In 2017, Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets, where he helped the team win a franchise-record 65 games in his debut season . Paul played one more season in Houston before being traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder as part of a package for Russell Westbrook in 2019. With the Thunder looking to rebuild, Paul was traded to the Phoenix Suns in 2020, where he reached the NBA Finals for the first time in his career in 2021. The following season, Paul helped the team win a franchise-record 64 games. After three seasons in Phoenix, Paul was traded and spent one season with the Golden State Warriors, where he came off the bench for the first time in his career. He later signed with the Spurs in 2024 .
Chris Paul was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina,[a] to Charles Edward Paul and Robin Jones. He grew up in Lewisville with his older brother, Charles ""C.J."" Paul.

A former athlete himself, Charles Sr. taught his sons basketball and football and coached them in various youth leagues throughout their childhoods",". He finished the competition with a tournament-high 44 assists, helping Team USA win the bronze medal in the process. At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, he played a key role off the bench, scoring 13 points in a gold medal game victory against Spain. In addition to the gold medal, Team USA also finished the competition with a perfect 8–0 record. Paul was promoted to the starting point guard position for the 2012 Olympics in London, averaging 8.2 points, 5.1 assists, and 1.6 steals per game en route to another gold medal and undefeated tournament .

Paul prefers playing in the half court versus playing up-tempo .
