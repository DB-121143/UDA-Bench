In 2006, he led a deal to acquire PNA Steel, ultimately selling it to Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. in 2008 for a net profit of $512 million. In May 2009, Gores purchased The San Diego Union-Tribune for an estimated $30 million (the newspaper was sold in 2011 for $110 million). By 2009, Gores had facilitated in excess of 100 deals through Platinum Equity. 

Gores had shown interest in purchasing and was one of the front runners to become the owner of the NBA's Detroit Pistons after the death of the long-time owner, Bill Davidson, in 2009. In October 2010, it was reported that then-Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Tigers owner, Mike Ilitch, would purchase Detroit's NBA franchise. But, after Ilitch's exclusive 30-day negotiating period with Davidson's widow (Karen) ended, Gores showed renewed interest. He secured an exclusive negotiating period of his own in January 2011 and was presumed to become the next owner of the Pistons 

Acquisition of the Detroit Pistons .
On June 1, 2011, Gores and Platinum Equity bought Palace Sports and Entertainment (PS&E) (the parent company of the Pistons and their former arena, The Palace of Auburn Hills) becoming the third owner in the franchise's 70-year history. The purchase price of $325 million was referred to as a ""shocking bargain"" by Crain's Detroit Business, although, in January 2011, Forbes had valued it at only $35 million more than eventual purchase price. Early in his tenure as owner, Gores approved $10-million worth of renovations to the Palace of Auburn Hills","

Steven Anthony Ballmer,68,American,Los Angeles Clippers,,3,".
Following the Donald Sterling scandal in May 2014, Ballmer was the highest bidder in an attempt to purchase the Los Angeles Clippers for a reported price of $2 billion, which was then the second-highest bid for a sports franchise in North American sports history (after the $2.15 billion sale of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012). After a California court confirmed the authority of Shelly Sterling to sell the team, it was announced on August 12, 2014, that Ballmer would become the Los Angeles Clippers owner .
On September 25, 2014, Ballmer said he would bar the team from using Apple products such as iPads, and replace them with Microsoft products. It has been reported that he had previously also barred his family from using iPhones.
In March 2020, Ballmer agreed to buy The Forum in Inglewood, California. The purchase would allow him to build the Intuit Dome in the nearby area since plans for a new Clippers' arena were opposed by the former owners of The Forum.
In a survey conducted by The Athletic in December 2020, Ballmer was voted the best owner in basketball. 

In 2021, ProPublica documented how Ballmer is using his ownership of various sports teams as a means to lower his federal income tax to as low as 12%, compared to around 35% for the athletes playing in the team. The report exposes how the Clippers were profitable before their acquisition by Ballmer, but then reported $700 million in losses for tax purposes in following years.

It premiered on September 13, 2004, but the series was canceled before the full season aired due to poor ratings.
In 2018, Cuban was no. 190 on Forbes' list of ""World's Richest People"", with a net worth of $3.9 billion.
Cuban financially supported Grokster in the Supreme Court case MGM v. Grokster . He is also a partner in Synergy Sports Technology, a web-based basketball scouting and video delivery tool used by many NBA teams. 

Cuban has also assisted ventures in the social software and distributed networking industries. He was an owner of IceRocket, a search engine that scours the blogosphere for content.
In 2005, Cuban invested $1.7 million in file-sharing company RedSwoosh, co-founded by Travis Kalanick, providing much-needed capital to the company after the early 2000s recession.

Cuban as owner of the Dallas Mavericks in 2008 On January 4, 2000, Cuban purchased a majority stake in the NBA's Dallas Mavericks for $285 million from H. Ross Perot Jr.
In the 20 years before Cuban bought the team, the Mavericks won only 40% of their games and had a playoff record of 21–32. In the 10 years following, the team won 69% of their regular season games and reached the playoffs in each of those seasons except for one . The Mavericks' playoff record with Cuban is 49–57, including their first trip to the NBA Finals in 2006, where they lost to the Miami Heat.
NBA team owners historically play more passive roles and watch basketball games from skyboxes; Cuban, however, sits alongside fans while donning team jerseys. Cuban travels in his private airplane—a Gulfstream V—to attend road games.
In May 2010, H. Ross Perot Jr., who retained 5% ownership, filed a lawsuit against Cuban, alleging the franchise was insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency . In June 2010, Cuban responded in a court filing maintaining Perot is wrongly seeking money to offset some $100 million in losses on the Victory Park real estate development. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2011, due in part to Cuban asserting proper management of the team due to its recent victory in the 2011 NBA Finals. In 2014, the 5th Circuit Court affirmed that decision on appeal. Following his initial defeat, Perot attempted to shut out Mavericks fans from use of the parking lots he controlled near the American Airlines Center .
In January 2018, Cuban announced the Mavericks would be accepting Bitcoin as payment for tickets in the following season. On March 4, 2021, Cuban announced the Mavericks would begin accepting Dogecoin as payment for both merchandise as well as tickets to games.
In early 2021, he decided to stop playing the National Anthem at Dallas Mavericks games in order to ""respect those whose believed the anthem did not represent them."" He also supported the movement as far back as late 2020. The NBA responded by requiring every team to play it, citing it as their ""long-standing policy""","

Benson and Allen (Portland Trail Blazers) are two of five female owners in the NBA, along with Jeanie Buss (Los Angeles Lakers), Miriam Adelson (Dallas Mavericks) and Ann Walton Kroenke (Denver Nuggets).
Tom Benson had planned on bequeathing the voting stock shares of the New Orleans Saints and New Orleans Pelicans to his daughter Renee Benson, grandson Ryan Benson LeBlanc, and granddaughter Rita Benson LeBlanc.
On December 27, 2014, Tom Benson wrote an e-mail to his daughter and two grandchildren stating he wanted ""no further contact with any of you ."" Gayle Benson was named his heir.
Tom Benson's daughter and grandchildren filed lawsuits challenging his decision to name Gayle his heir, questioning his mental competency.
Tom Benson was determined to be mentally competent and was allowed to change his will to leave ownership of the New Orleans Saints and the New Orleans Pelicans to his wife. 

Labor complaints

Rodney Henry, former personal assistant to Tom Benson, filed a lawsuit accusing the New Orleans Saints and Gayle Benson of racism and violations of federal labor laws. The lawsuit claimed that Gayle Benson had treated him with disrespect because of his race. An NFL arbitrator ruled in favor of Henry and against the Saints on the labor complaint, awarding him overtime pay, a contractual payout for his dismissal, and attorney's fees; however, the same arbitrator ruled against Henry on the claims of racism.

On April 13, 1995, Stan Kroenke helped Georgia Frontiere move the National Football League's Los Angeles Rams from Anaheim to St. Louis by purchasing a 30% share of the team.
In 2010, Kroenke exercised his right of first refusal to purchase the remaining interest in the Rams from the Frontiere estate. On August 25, 2010, he became full owner of the Rams by unanimous consent of the NFL . To gain approval from NFL owners, Kroenke agreed to turn over control of the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche to his son, Josh, by the end of 2010, and he had to give up his majority stake in both teams in December 2014. The NFL does not allow its owners to hold majority control of major league teams in other NFL markets. On October 7, 2015, the NFL approved transfer of his ownership stake of the Avalanche and Nuggets to his wife, Ann Walton Kroenke. 

In April 2010, as he was trying to gain full ownership of the team, and knowing of an escape clause in the Rams lease at the Edward Jones Dome, Stan Kroenke said: ""I'm going to attempt to do everything that I can to keep the Rams in St. Louis.""
In February 2013, the Rams and the City of St. Louis went to arbitration over a clause in the Rams' lease that stated the Rams current stadium must be in the top tier of NFL stadiums

Sports management . Other minor investors included Art Wrubel, Jason Levien, Adam Aron, Martin Geller, David Heller, James Lassiter, Marc Leder, Michael Rubin, Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Erick Thohir. Harris presided over an era in 76ers history known as ""The Process"", in which the team tanked for better NBA draft lottery odds . Supporting a plan formed by general manager Sam Hinkie, the 76ers went 19–63 during the 2013–14 season, 18–64 in 2014–15, and 10–72 in 2015–16, the latter being the third-worst record in NBA history. The Process was unpopular with NBA executives and team owners, who lobbied league commissioner Adam Silver to step in due to the 76ers' poor performance affecting league revenue sharing . Harris would eventually agree to a suggestion by Silver to hire Jerry Colangelo, former owner of the Phoenix Suns, as team chairman in December 2015 with Hinkie stepping down in April 2016. 2014 draft selection and future NBA MVP Joel Embiid was among the players taken during the era, with the team having made five straight postseason appearances starting with the 2017–18 season. The 76ers were valued at $4.13 billion by Sportico in 2023",N/A,". In 2023, Harris and Blitzer explored buying stakes in the English football club Manchester United.
Maryland governor Wes Moore and Harris at a Washington Commanders game, 2023 In 2023, Harris headed a group that purchased the NFL's Washington Commanders and Northwest Stadium from Daniel Snyder for $6.05 billion, the highest price ever paid for a sports team. The group has 20 limited partners, including Danaher and Glenstone founder Mitchell Rales, Hall of Fame basketball player and entrepreneur Magic Johnson, and D.C. venture capitalist Mark Ein . Harris and Johnson had bid on the NFL's Denver Broncos the previous year before it was sold to a group headed by Walmart executives Rob Walton and Greg Penner. He was the third limited partner of the Steelers since 2012 to become majority owner of another NFL team, joining Jimmy Haslam of the Cleveland Browns and David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers. Around the same time, he bought a minority stake in Joe Gibbs Racing by way of HBSE. In 2024, the pair sold their stake in the Steelers to Art Rooney II and Thomas Tull as NFL rules mandate a majority owner can not hold interest in another team . Harris and Blitzer have also invested in youth sports brands, forming Unrivaled Sports as a parent company in March 2024 with capital from The Chernin Group.
Harris employs general managers to operate his teams and venues, with diversity, equity, and inclusion and player empowerment being promoted within his workplace culture. He also invests heavily in sports science and analytics, with 76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey being a leading proponent of the field . In March 2020, Harris and Blitzer committed to pay Prudential Center employees for any canceled events due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw the NBA and NHL suspend operations for much of the year. The same month, he introduced plans to reduce salaries of HBSE, 76ers, and Devils employees making over $100,000 by 20% but reversed the decision within a week after receiving public criticism, including an effort by 76ers All-Star player Joel Embiid to cover the losses of those affected.",". In September 2016, Harris and Blitzer bought the esports organizations Dignitas and Apex Gaming through the 76ers and merged them under the Dignitas brand. In September 2017, the pair founded Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE) to consolidate their sports ventures. The company was valuated by Forbes at $11.86 billion in 2024 . In addition to the 76ers and Devils, HBSE also owns the Delaware Blue Coats of the NBA G League and the Utica Comets of the American Hockey League, HBSE Real Estate, the venture capital firm HBSE Ventures, and the event and marketing firm Elevate Sports Ventures. In June 2020, Harris and Blitzer bought a combined $140 million stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL) . In 2022, he headed a group consisting of Blitzer, airline executive Martin Broughton, politician and Olympic gold medalist Sebastian Coe, tennis player Serena Williams, and racing driver Lewis Hamilton that pursued a bid to purchase Chelsea of the Premier League before it was sold to Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital for €4.25 billion ($4.5 billion).
